The NetworkingManager is a script component handling all your Networking related settings, your Networked Prefabs and your registered scene names. A Transport component is needed on the same GameObject. It is responsible for handling IP adresses and additional settings.

### Starting a Server, Host or Client
The NetworkingManager allows you to start/stop the Networking. It provides the same functions for Server, Host and Client.
The Host functions as Server and Client simultaneously. 
```csharp
NetworkingManager.Singleton.StartServer();      //or
NetworkingManager.Singleton.StartHost();        //or
NetworkingManager.Singleton.StartClient();
```
Note: When starting a Server/Host or joining a running session as client, the NetworkingManager will spawn a ```Player Object``` belonging to/representing that Player. You can choose which prefab shall be spawned as ```Player Object``` in the NetworkingManager Component under ```NetworkedPrefabs```. Simply tick the corresponding "Default Player Prefab" checkbox there.
Only the ```PlayerObject``` will return true for ```IsLocalPlayer``` on the corresponding machine, use ```IsOwner``` for non Player Objects instead.

### Connecting
When Starting a Client, the NetworkingManager uses the IP and the Port provided in your "Transport" component for connecting.
You can use different transports and have to replace the type inside the following GetComponent<> accordingly, but for UNET transport it looks like this:
```csharp
NetworkingManager.Singleton.GetComponent<UnetTransport>().ConnectAddress = "127.0.0.1"; //takes string
NetworkingManager.Singleton.GetComponent<UnetTransport>().ConnectPort = 12345;          //takes integer
```

### Disconnecting
Disconnecting is rather simple, but you have to remember, that you cannot use the ```NetworkSceneManager``` for scene switching in most Disconnecting cases. As soon as you stop the Client, Server or Host you have to use UnityEngine.SceneManagement instead.
```csharp
public void Disconnect()
{
    if (IsHost) 
    {
        NetworkingManager.Singleton.StopHost();
    }
    else if (IsClient) 
    {
        NetworkingManager.Singleton.StopClient();
    }
    else if (IsServer) 
    {
        NetworkingManager.Singleton.StopServer();
    }
    
    UnityEngine.SceneManagement.SceneManager.LoadScene("MainMenu");
}
```

The only case where you could use the ```NetworkSceneManager``` for disconnecting, would be if the Server/Host switches back to MainMenu or similar for everyone and then Stopping the Server and all the Clients. 
(See ```NetworkSceneManager``` for more details).
